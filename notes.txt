so for food 
generate food ? and then render
show food at random location unless it intersects with existing arr ones

now check for head intersection. 

generateFood(); //at start and store the div in global

if (interesect){
 var oldDv = fdiv;
 generateFood();
 oldDv.style.zoom = 1.2;
 //now also wait for last div to cross the food, then append the last div to the arr
}
